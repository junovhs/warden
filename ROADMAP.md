# Warden Protocol Roadmap

## Philosophy

**The Two-Layer Model:**
1. **Files** (~2k tokens) - The organizational unit. Right-sized for context windows.
2. **Contracts** - The semantic unit. Machine-verifiable intent at symbol level.

**Why Constraints Matter for AI:**
- Cyclomatic complexity limits bound hallucination surface
- Nesting depth limits prevent AI losing track of scope  
- Function length limits fight attention degradation
- File size limits respect context window economics

These aren't style preferences. They're **containment protocols**.

## Current State: v0.4.1

- [x] **Core loop: knit → chat → apply → verify <!-- test: tests/integration_core.rs -->**
- [x] **Self-hosting (Warden passes its own rules) <!-- test: tests/integration_core.rs -->**
- [x] **Path safety validation <!-- test: tests/security_validation.rs -->**
- [x] **Markdown block rejection <!-- test: tests/integration_apply.rs -->**
- [x] **Backup system <!-- test: tests/integration_apply.rs -->**

---

## v0.5.0 — Bulletproof Apply
- [x] **Roadmap Integration (warden roadmap) <!-- test: tests/integration_roadmap.rs -->**
- [x] **Update README with roadmap docs**
- [x] **Pack defaults to --prompt, --noprompt to disable <!-- test: tests/integration_pack.rs -->**
- [x] **Pack copies file path to clipboard for attachment paste**
- [x] **TypeScript auto-detection uses biome**
- [x] **Integration tests for all features <!-- test: tests/integration_core.rs -->**
- [x] **Unified Apply <!-- test: tests/integration_apply.rs -->**
  *Implemented: warden apply now scans for ===ROADMAP=== blocks*
  *Integrated as core module with state-transition logic*

**Theme:** If it applies, it's valid. If it's invalid, it rejects hard.

### Validation Hardening

- [x] **Path safety validation**
  Blocks: `../` traversal, absolute paths, `.git/`, `.env`, `.ssh/`, `.aws/`, hidden files.

- [x] **Markdown block rejection**
  Rejects fenced code blocks in file content.

- [x] **Truncation detection <!-- test: tests/integration_apply.rs -->**
  Reject obviously incomplete files:
  - Unbalanced braces/brackets
  - Truncation markers: `// ...`, `// rest of file`
  - Zero false positives logic
  - **Ignore Support**: `warden:ignore` bypasses checks for specific lines.

- [x] **Robust Delimiter Protocol (Nabla Format) <!-- test: tests/integration_pack.rs -->**
  Replace fragile XML with high-entropy Unicode fences:
  
      ∇∇∇ src/main.rs ∇∇∇
      fn main() {}
      ∆∆∆
  
  Benefits:
  - Never interpreted as HTML/Markdown
  - Never appears in real code
  - Trivial to regex
  - AI can't confuse output with format

### Workflow Enhancement

- [x] **Error injection in knit**
  When `knit --prompt` runs, append current violations.

- [x] **`warden apply --commit`**
  On success: `git add .` → auto-generate commit message → commit.
  
  *If it passes validation, commit it. Git is your undo.*
---

## v0.6.0 — Context Intelligence
- [x] **Smart Context (Focus Mode) <!-- test: tests/integration_pack.rs -->**
- [x] **Config Wizard <!-- test: src/wizard.rs -->**
  *Implemented: warden pack <target> skeletonizes background files*

**Theme:** The Map vs. Territory problem.

### The Skeletonizer

Strip function bodies, keep signatures:

    // Full (Territory)
    pub fn process(data: &[u8]) -> Result<Output> {
        let parsed = parse(data)?;
        validate(&parsed)?;
        transform(parsed)
    }
    
    // Skeleton (Map)
    pub fn process(data: &[u8]) -> Result<Output> { ... }

- [x] **`knit --skeleton` - All files skeletonized <!-- test: tests/integration_skeleton.rs -->**
  *Implemented using tree-sitter for RS, PY, TS*
- [x] **`knit src/main.rs --smart` - Full code for target + skeletons for rest <!-- test: tests/integration_pack.rs -->**
  *Implemented as: warden pack --target <file>*

### Dependency Graphing

- [x] **Parse `mod`, `use`, `import`, `require` statements <!-- test: tests/integration_graph.rs -->**
  *Implemented in src/graph/imports.rs and src/graph/resolver.rs*
- [ ] Build local dependency graph
- [ ] Auto-include dependencies in context

---

## v0.7.0 — Verification & Safety
- [x] **Test Traceability <!-- test: src/roadmap/audit.rs -->**

**Theme:** Beyond "it compiles."

### Feature Anchors (Anti-Lobotomy)
Prevent "accidental lobotomy" where AI refactors code and silently drops functionality.

- **Concept:** Explicitly declare "This code implements Feature X".
- **Mechanism:** `#[warden::feature("auth")]` attributes or `features.toml`.
- **Enforcement:** If a registered feature anchor disappears or its associated tests vanish, Warden halts.
- **Deprecation:** Explicit command `warden feature deprecate <name>` required to remove.

### Property-Based Testing

- [ ] **`warden gen-test <file>`**
  AI writes property tests (proptest/hypothesis), not unit tests.
  
      "Assert invariants. What must ALWAYS be true?"

### Function-Level Reporting

    src/engine.rs
    
      fn process_batch() [Line 45]
      ├─ Complexity: 14 (max 5)
      ├─ Depth: 5 (max 2)
      ├─ Contributing factors:
      │   ├─ 3 nested ifs (lines 52, 58, 61)
      │   └─ 2 complex match guards (lines 67, 89)
      └─ Suggestion: Extract inner match

### Incremental Scanning

- [ ] Track file mtimes in `.warden_cache`
- [ ] Use `git status` for changed files
- [ ] Full rescan on config change

---

## v0.8.0 — Ecosystem

**Theme:** CI/CD integration.

- [ ] `warden --format json` - Machine-readable output
- [ ] SARIF output for GitHub Code Scanning
- [ ] `warden hook install` - Pre-commit hook
- [ ] GitHub Action for PR checks
- [ ] Documented exit codes

---

## v1.0.0 — Release

- [ ] Published to crates.io
- [ ] Homebrew formula
- [ ] Scoop/Winget packages
- [ ] Documentation site
- [ ] Logo and branding

---

## Future

### AI-Native Linting
- Global state detection (`static mut`, singletons)
- Impure function warnings (returns value, takes no args)
- Deep inheritance check (> 1 level)

### Metrics Dashboard
SQLite backend. Complexity trends over time. Codebase health charts.

### Session Branches
`warden session start` → timestamped branch
`warden apply --commit` → atomic commits
`warden session merge` → squash to main

## Not Doing

- **VS Code Extension** - IDE lock-in, maintenance burden
- **Watch mode** - Complexity without clear benefit
- **Markdown fallback parsing** - Enforce format discipline
- **"Smart" fixing** - Warden rejects, doesn't repair

---

## Principles

1. **Reject bad input, don't fix it**
   Warden is a gatekeeper, not a fixer.

2. **Git is the undo system**
   Don't reinvent version control.

3. **Explicit > Magic**
   If AI doesn't follow format, fail loudly.

4. **Containment over craftsmanship**
   For AI, constraints aren't style—they're safety.

5. **Eat your own dogfood**
   Warden must pass its own rules.

6. **The dream: perfect modularity**
   Take any file to AI, bring it back, it slots in perfectly.
   Contracts make this verifiable.
